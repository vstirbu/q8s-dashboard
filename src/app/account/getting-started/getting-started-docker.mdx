## Installation

### Prerequisites

Install the required tools and set up the environment to use Qubernetes TORQS.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

### Cluster configuration

Get your cluster configuration file from the [settings](/account/settings) page.

## Usage

Replace `/path/to/config` and `/path/to/workspace` to your configuration. Start Jupyter Lab in the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 \
  -v /path/to/config:/home/jupyter/.kube/config  \
  -v /path/to/workspace:/workspace \
  ghcr.io/torqs-project/q8s-devenv:main
```

Open notebook and select the Q8s kernel to run the quantum circuits in the cluster.

## Limitations

### Notebook execution

The kernel is able to execute only one cell. All the code should be in a single cell. Notebook magic functions are not supported.

### Dependencies

The docker image used to run the circuits in the cluster is currently hardcoded with the following dependencies:

```
qiskit==1.0.0
qiskit-aer-gpu==0.13.3
qiskit_algorithms
qiskit_ibm_runtime
numpy
networkx
```
