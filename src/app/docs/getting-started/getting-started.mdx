title: Qubernetes user guide

## Introduction

Qubernetes is a tool that allows users to run quantum circuits on GPU accelerated simulators using Kubernetes. It is designed to be a simple and easy-to-use tool without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

## Getting started

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

Install the required tools and set up the environment to use Qubernetes TORQS.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
- [kubelogin](https://github.com/int128/kubelogin)

Install Jupyter (in a [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments) preferably).

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

#### Install Qubernetes kernel

Install the kernel package.

```bash
pip install git+https://git@github.com/torqs-project/q8s-kernel.git@python-kernel#egg=q8s_kernel
```

#### Configure the kernel (should be automated in the previous step)

Create a directory `spec` with a file `kernel.json` and add the following content:

```json
{
  "argv": ["python", "-m", "q8s_kernel", "-f", "{connection_file}"],
  "display_name": "Python Q8s kernel",
  "language": "python"
}
```

Configure Jupyter to use the kernel.

```bash
jupyter kernelspec install spec --name=q8s-kernel --sys-prefix
```

#### Configure Kubernetes

Save the Kubernetes configuration file to a location and set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to the path of the configuration file.

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
```

Verify that the configuration is correct.

```bash
kubectl get jobs
```

Should open a browser window to authenticate with the Kubernetes cluster. (Login using the Google account and let Vlad know that you have done this step. He will activate your rights to use the cluster.)

### Usage

Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open notebook and select the Q8s kernel.

## Limitations

### Notebook execution

The kernel is able to execute only one cell. All the code should be in a single cell. Notebook magic functions are not supported.

### Dependencies

The docker image used to run the circuits is hardcoded with the following dependencies:

```
qiskit==1.0.0
qiskit-aer-gpu==0.13.3
qiskit_algorithms
qiskit_ibm_runtime
numpy
networkx
```
