## Notebook execution

The kernel is able to execute only one cell. All the code including imports should be in a single cell:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
from qiskit_aer import Aer, AerSimulator, AerError
import os

def demo_function(shotsAmount=1000):
    simulator = AerSimulator(method='statevector', device='GPU')

    circuit = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
    circuit.h(0)
    circuit.cx(0, 1)
    circuit.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

    compiled_circuit = transpile(circuit, simulator)
    job = simulator.run(compiled_circuit, shots=shotsAmount)
    result = job.result()
    counts = result.get_counts()

    print("Total count for 00 and 11 are:", counts)
    print(circuit)
    return counts

result = demo_function(2000)
```

Notebook magic commands are not supported:

```python
%pip install qiskit
```

## Dependencies

The default container image used to run the circuits in the cluster is currently hardcoded with the following dependencies:

```
qiskit==1.0.0
qiskit-aer-gpu==0.13.3
qiskit_algorithms
qiskit_ibm_runtime
numpy
networkx
```
